happy valentines day!!

there are so many things i want to remind you of on this day that i could not fit on a card.

using this one day to celebrate my love for you is simply not enough. there are not enough seconds in one day for me to be able to express to you how grateful i am to have you in my life. 

i love you, tiffanie

i love the way when you smile your eyes light up and you can see your pearly whites from space. i love how soft you are. i love how stylish you are. i love how passionate you are. i love how when you wake up you look like the definition of sleepy & they use your picture in the dictionary and the little noises you use to communicate. i love your cricket feet. i love how you decorate. i love how excited you get about arts and crafts. i love that you make me excited about the things you are excited about. i love the way you think. 

i love you, tiffanie

i am so happy to share every moment with you and so excited to share a future with you. no matter what happens, as long as i am with you, i know everything will be okay. you bring me peace and tranquility. i can't say it enough, so i am looking forward to keep on showing you how much i love you and how much you mean to me for the rest of our lives.


l♡ve always,
